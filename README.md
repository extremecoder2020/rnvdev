**Hey**!<br> 
I'm **Raphael Viana**, from **Brazil** (Rio de Janeiro).<br>

- I love to learn, the process to learn makes me happy, i don't know maybe ceretonine?<br>
- So it's difficult to me keep my whole life only in one technology, as can you see in my repository.<br>
- I recognize myself as etenity learner and don't use much labels about that.
<br>
I always seek my best, each day it's a day to improve myself as human and professional.
<br>
